			Hi! 👋 I'm Ryan, the founder, developer, and creative mind behind Pixel
			Dynasty Development. I specialize in building clean, modern, and efficient
			websites that help small businesses and non-profits make a big impact
			online.
		</p>
		<p class="text-light-text dark:text-dark-text text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
			My journey into tech started right here in East Tennessee, playing
			baseball at <strong>Jefferson County High School</strong>. That same drive
			and dedication led me to <strong>Walters State</strong>, where I earned my
			Associate's Degree in Computer Science, turning a passion for
			problem-solving into a professional skill.
		</p>
		<p class="text-light-text dark:text-dark-text text-lg leading-relaxed">
			Why "Pixel Dynasty"? Because I believe every great idea starts with a
			single pixel. My mission is to take your vision and build it, pixel by
			pixel, into a digital experience that helps your business thrive.
